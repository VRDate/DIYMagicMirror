Language Reference
See the extended reference for more advanced features of the Arduino languages and the libraries page for interfacing with particular types of hardware. 


Arduino programs can be divided in three main parts: structure, values (variables and constants), and functions. The Arduino language is based on C/C++. 


Structure
setup() 
loop() 

Control Structures
if 
if...else 
for 
switch case 
while 
do... while 
break 
continue 
return 

Further Syntax
; (semicolon) 
{} (curly braces) 
// (single line comment) 
/* */ (multi-line comment) 

Arithmetic Operators
= (assignment) 
+ (addition) 
- (subtraction) 
* (multiplication) 
/ (division) 
% (modulo) 

Comparison Operators
== (equal to) 
!= (not equal to) 
< (less than) 
> (greater than) 
<= (less than or equal to) 
>= (greater than or equal to) 

Boolean Operators
&& (and) 
|| (or) 
! (not) 

Compound Operators
++ (increment) 
-- (decrement) 
+= (compound addition) 
-= (compound subtraction) 
*= (compound multiplication) 
/= (compound division) 

Variables
Variables are expressions that you can use in programs to store values, such as a sensor reading from an analog pin. 


Constants
Constants are particular values with specific meanings. 


HIGH | LOW 
INPUT | OUTPUT 
true | false 

Integer Constants 

Data Types
Variables can have various types, which are described below. 


boolean 
char 
byte 
int 
unsigned int 
long 
unsigned long 
float 
double 
string 
array 
void 

Conversion
char() 
byte() 
int() 
long()
